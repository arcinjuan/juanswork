      <p>This site was 100% designed and built by me. I did use some libraries to help speed up development and to demonstrate my ability to develop using outside libraries. For each site, within my portfolio, that I built, I mixed the libraries used for a wider range of knowledge. For this particular I site I used the following:</p>

      <ul>
      	<li>Create React App</li>
      	<li>Vanilla CSS</li>
      	<li>React Router DOM</li>
      	<li>React Icons</li>
      	<li>Styled Componants</li>
      	<li>React Transition Group</li>
